	<h2>Self-Care Ideas for the Body</h2>


<br>1. Give your body ten minutes of mindful attention. Use the body scan technique to check in with each part of your body.<br>

<br>2. Oxygenate by taking three deep breaths. Breathe into your abdomen, and let the air puff out your stomach and chest.<br>

<br>3. Get down and boogie. Put on your favorite upbeat record and shake your booty.<br>

<br>4. Stretch out the kinks. If you’re at work, you can always head to the bathroom to avoid strange looks.<br>

<br>5. Run (or walk, depending on your current physical health) for a few minutes. Or go up and down the stairs three times.<br>

<br>6. Narrow your food choices. Pick two healthy breakfasts, lunches, and dinners and rotate for the week.<br>

<br>7. Activate your self-soothing system. Stroke your own arm, or if that feels too weird, moisturize.<br>

<br>8. Get to know yourself intimately. Look lovingly and without judgment at yourself naked. (Use a mirror to make sure you get to know all of you!)<br>

<br>9. Make one small change to your diet for the week. Drink an extra glass of water each day, or have an extra portion of veggies each meal.<br>

<br>10. Give your body a treat. Pick something from your wardrobe that feels great next to your skin.<br>

<br>11. Be still. Sit somewhere green, and be quiet for a few minutes.<br>

<br>12. Get fifteen minutes of sun, especially if you’re in a cold climate. (Use sunscreen if appropriate.)<br>

<br>13. Inhale an upbeat smell. Try peppermint to suppress food cravings and boost mood and motivation.<br>

<br>14. Have a good laugh. Read a couple of comic strips that you enjoy. (For inspiration, try Calvin and Hobbes, Dilbert, or xkcd.)<br>

<br>15. Take a quick nap. Ten to twenty minutes can reduce your sleep debt and leave you ready for action.<br>
