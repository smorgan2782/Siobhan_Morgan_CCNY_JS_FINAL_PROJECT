		<h2>Self-Care Ideas for the Soul</h2>

<br>1. Imagine you’re your best friend. If you were, what would you tell yourself right now? Look in the mirror and say it.<br>

<br>2. Use your commute for a “Beauty Scavenger Hunt.” Find five unexpected beautiful things on your way to work.<br>

<br>3. Help someone. Carry a bag, open a door, or pick up an extra carton of milk for a neighbor.<br>

<br>4. Check in with your emotions. Sit quietly and just name without judgment what you’re feeling.<br>

<br>5. Write out your thoughts. Go for fifteen minutes on anything bothering you. Then let it go as you burn or bin the paper.<br>

<br>6. Choose who you spend your time with today. Hang out with “Radiators” who emit enthusiasm and positivity, and not “Drains” whose pessimism and negativity robs energy.<br>

<br>7. Stroke a pet. If you don’t have one, go to the park and find one. (Ask first!)<br>

<br>8. Get positive feedback. Ask three good friends to tell you what they love about you.<br>

<br>9. Make a small connection. Have a few sentences of conversation with someone in customer service such as a sales assistant or barista.<br>

<br>10. Splurge a little. Buy a small luxury as a way of valuing yourself.<br>

<br>11. Have a self-date. Spend an hour alone doing something that nourishes you (reading, your hobby, visiting a museum or gallery, etc.)<br>

<br>12. Exercise a signature strength. Think about what you’re good at, and find an opportunity for it today.<br>

<br>13. Take a home spa. Have a long bath or shower, sit around in your bathrobe, and read magazines.<br>

<br>14. Ask for help—big or small, but reach out.<br>

<br>15. Plan a two-day holiday for next weekend. Turn off your phone, tell people you’ll be away, and then do something new in your own town.<br>
